sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: is the least efficient algorithm but it has the same runtime as the selection sort when the file is sorted

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: is the fastest among algorithms and when the file is reversed the runtime is longer

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: the runtime is the same for all file types
